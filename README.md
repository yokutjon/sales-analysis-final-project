# sales-analysis-final-project
ISTA 421 - Introduction to Machine Learning / Final Project. 
This project applies regression, classification, resampling, and regularization techniques to a restaurant sales dataset. 
It is the final project for my Machine Learning course. The goal is to demonstrate practical end-to-end data analysis 
and predictive modeling using Python and real-world data.
